2.1.x:
- create documentation/manual
- improve error handling and logging
- improve validation of received Error and Acknowledgment messages
- configure CPA caching (or load CPA once per message)?
/ improve duplicate message handling
	- store messages with unknown cpaId???
	- store duplicate messages???
- get hostname (needed for messageId) from CPA

2.2.x:
/ implement Ping Service
/ implement MessageStatus Service
- implement MessageOrder
- implement syncReplyMode?
- implement ackRequested (mode=never)
- implement duplicateElimination (mode=never)
- implement Encoding?
- implement JMS Client interface?
- implement dynamic cxf outbound endpoints (request url has to be resolved from CPA)?

3.x.x:
- update adapter to Mule 3
- support additional protocols besides http(s), like mail, file, etc?
- store http response status code with ebms send event

considerations:
- change wsdl definition to one operation (containing all ebxml elements) and 'parse' message in Mule?
- replace cxf interface?
